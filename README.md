# Handling Imbalanced Datasets for Predictive Modeling

This repository provides Python implementations and explanations for addressing class imbalance in predictive modeling, particularly relevant to scenarios like customer response prediction in bank telemarketing.

## Overview:

Many real-world datasets exhibit class imbalance, where one class significantly outnumbers the others. This imbalance can severely impact model performance, especially when the goal is to accurately predict the minority class. This repository focuses on techniques to mitigate these challenges, using the context of a bank telemarketing dataset as a primary example.

## Key Challenges:

* **Class Imbalance:** Datasets with a disproportionate representation of classes (e.g., 88.5% non-response vs. 11.5% response).
* **Accuracy Paradox:** High overall accuracy can be misleading when the minority class is poorly predicted.
* **True Positive Focus:** The goal is often to maximize the identification of the minority class (e.g., customers who will subscribe).

## Implementation:

This repository includes Python implementations of:

* **Upsampling:** Replicating minority class instances to balance the dataset.
* **Downsampling:** Removing majority class instances to achieve balance.
* **Bootstrapping:** Resampling techniques for estimating uncertainty and model validation.
* **Evaluation Metrics:** Using precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC, which are more appropriate for imbalanced datasets than simple accuracy.

## Usage:

1.  Prepare your imbalanced dataset (e.g., bank telemarketing data).
2.  Run the provided Python scripts for upsampling, downsampling, or bootstrapping.
3.  Evaluate model performance using appropriate metrics (precision, recall, F1-score, AUC-ROC).
4.  Interpret results and adjust resampling techniques as needed.

## Key Concepts:

* **Class Imbalance:** The unequal distribution of classes in a dataset.
* **Accuracy Paradox:** The misleading nature of accuracy in imbalanced datasets.
* **Upsampling (Oversampling):** Increasing the minority class sample size.
* **Downsampling (Undersampling):** Decreasing the majority class sample size.
* **Bootstrapping:** Resampling with replacement to estimate statistics and validate models.
* **Precision, Recall, F1-Score, AUC-ROC:** Evaluation metrics suitable for imbalanced datasets.

## Output:

* Resampled datasets (upsampled or downsampled).
* Model evaluation metrics (precision, recall, F1-score, AUC-ROC).
* Insights into the impact of resampling techniques on model performance.
* Analysis of feature importance and model coefficients, if applicable.
