# Random Forest Implementation for Classification or Regression

This repository provides a Python implementation of the Random Forest algorithm for both classification and regression tasks.

## Purpose:

* Performs classification or regression by aggregating the predictions of multiple decision trees.
* Reduces overfitting and improves prediction accuracy compared to single decision trees.
* Provides feature importance estimates.
* Offers a robust and versatile machine learning algorithm.

## Implementation:

* Uses Python's `scikit-learn` library to implement the Random Forest regressor or classifier.
* Allows customization of parameters such as the number of trees, maximum tree depth, and feature sampling.
* Implements bagging (bootstrap aggregating) and random feature selection.
* Provides functionality for model evaluation (e.g., accuracy, MSE, feature importance).

## Usage:

1.  Install necessary Python packages (e.g., `scikit-learn`, `pandas`, `numpy`).
2.  Input your dataset (features and target variable).
3.  Run the provided Python script (`random_forest.py`).
4.  Specify parameters such as the number of trees and maximum depth.
5.  Interpret output:
    * The script outputs model evaluation metrics (e.g., accuracy, MSE).
    * Feature importance scores are provided.
    * Predictions for test data are generated.

## Key Concepts:

* **Random Forest:** An ensemble learning method that combines multiple decision trees.
* **Bagging (Bootstrap Aggregating):** Creating multiple subsets of the training data with replacement.
* **Random Feature Selection:** Selecting a random subset of features at each tree node.
* **Ensemble Learning:** Combining multiple models to improve performance.
* **Feature Importance:** Measures the contribution of each feature to the model's predictions.

## Output:

* Model evaluation metrics (e.g., accuracy for classification, MSE for regression).
* Feature importance scores.
* Predictions on the test set.
* Information about the parameters used (number of trees, max depth, etc.).
